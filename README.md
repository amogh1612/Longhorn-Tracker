# Longhorn-Tracker
I, Amogh Kumar, and Bahuliya Manyapu created The Longhorn Tracker web app to incentivize student involvement in school events via points for rewards. It was designed for the Georgia FBLA State Leadership Conference, winning recognition as Finalist, Top 10, and State Winners in Coding &amp; Programming. The aim was to create a dynamic school community.
